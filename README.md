# Spotify_Data_Analysis

Two projects created using a [data set from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks) of over 160,000 tracks released from 1920 - 2020 that contains data pertaining to [audio features of a song](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#endpoint-get-audio-features)


## PROJECT 1: Time Series Analysis of Audio & Track Features Based on Year of Release 

Stemming from a 10-minute car judgmental rant from my dad about my playlist choice, I examined the audio qualities of tracks across the years to see if he's right about today's music. 

* Explored changes in audio and track features of songs based on year of release.  
* Comparison of these features from tracks of Yesterday's Greats with Today's current top artists.
* A quick look at some of the artists whose content we are consuming today.
